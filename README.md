## Project Overview:

### **Backend (Server & Database)**:
1. **RESTful API Development**:
   - Created a scalable backend using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, delivering a RESTful API for managing book data, user accounts, and orders.

   - Integrated functionality for bulk uploading of book data, images, and stock levels to the system.

   - Enabled multiple image uploads with **file handling** for book covers, ensuring the uniqueness of each image to prevent file overwriting.

5. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Followed security best practices by implementing **data validation**, **password hashing** (using bcrypt), and **sanitization** to protect the platform from attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
